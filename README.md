# Sorting Visualizer

A web-based tool to visualize how various sorting algorithms work. This project helps in understanding the logic and the efficiency of each sorting algorithm by visually looking at each step and swap visually.

**[Live Demo Link]()**

---

## Features
* **Real-time Visualization:** Visualize and compare different sorting methods by watching every step and swap in real time.
* **Multiple Algorithms:** Implements classic/most common sorthing methods.

## Algorithms Implemented

Some of the algorithms implemented are:

1.  **Bubble Sort:** A simple comparison sort that repeatedly steps through the list and compares two adjacent elements.
2.  **Merge Sort:** A divide-and-conquer algorithm that provides $O(n \log n)$ efficiency.
3.  **Quick Sort:** A highly efficient, pick-a-pivot sorting method.
4.  **Heap Sort:** A comparison-based sorting technique based on a Binary Heap data structure.

## Complexity Analysis

| Algorithm | Best Time Complexity | Average Time Complexity | Worst Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bubble Sort** | $O(n)$ | $\Theta(n^2)$ | $O(n^2)$ | $O(1)$ |
| **Merge Sort** | $O(n \log n)$ | $O(n \log n)$ | $O(n \log n)$ | $O(n)$ |
| **Quick Sort** | $O(n \log n)$ | $O(n \log n)$ | $O(n^2)$ | $O(\log n)$ |
| **Heap Sort** | $O(n \log n)$ | $O(n \log n)$ | $O(n \log n)$ | $O(1)$ |
